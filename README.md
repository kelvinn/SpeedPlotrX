SpeedPlotrX
===========

A basic GUI (using PyGTK) to plot driving speeds from a GPX file.

I originally wrote this back in 2008, but thought I would toss it up here to illustrate how it doesn't take much to create a program in Python. With less than 100 lines of code, we have a GUI and tool to read GPX files, parse it, calculate moving averages, and plot it.

I've just run this again (2014), and it still works :)
